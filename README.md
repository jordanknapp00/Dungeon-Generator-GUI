# Dungeon Generator GUI

Dungeon Generator GUI (AKA DungenGUI) is an implementation of my [Dungeon Generator](https://github.com/jordanknapp00/Dungeon-Generator) (AKA dungen) program, which itself just generates simple dungeons using an algorithm similar to the one used in [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)) (1980). However, while the original version of this program was command-line only, this version features a GUI.

Many of the details between the graphical and non-graphical versions of the program are the same. They use the same algorithm and feature the same customizable parameters. All parameters can be customized via the GUI. Instead of redirecting the output to a text file, this program allows you to simply save a text version of your dungeon.

Like the non-graphical version of the program, this is meant to be a simple, no-frills program that gives you a good starting point for, say, a D&D dungeon. It gives you a basic layout from which you can begin to fill in further details.

## Dungeon Parameters

See the [README for the command-line version](https://github.com/jordanknapp00/Dungeon-Generator/blob/main/README.md) for more information on details such as the different dungeon parameters.
